## Alex's Portfolio Website


## Self-Reflection

Working on this portfolio redesign gave me the chance to think more critically about how design and functionality influence user experience. It was not just about making a site look good, but about ensuring it communicates clearly and encourages interaction.

## What I Learned

I learned how to apply design frameworks like HITS to evaluate a website. On the technical side, I gained a better understanding of accessibility standards how design improves responsiveness.

## Challenges I Faced

One of the main challenges was balancing simplicity with detail. I wanted the portfolio to remain clean and easy to navigate, but also provide enough depth through case studies and blog content. To overcome this, I used a structured layout with clear navigation and CTAs, ensuring the site stays user-friendly without overwhelming visitors.

## Use of AI or External Help

I referred to resources like **MDN Web Docs** and **W3Schools** for technical clarity, and browsed real developer portfolios for inspiration. From this, I learned how to translate research and examples into my own design ideas while maintaining originality.

## If I Had More Time…

I would build an actual wireframe or prototype of the redesign, possibly in Figma or directly in code. I’d also explore adding animations, a dark mode toggle, and integrating a lightweight CMS for blog content. These improvements would make the site more engaging, flexible, and closer to a live professional portfolio.
