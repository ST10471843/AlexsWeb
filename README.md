- Showcase Alex’s skills, projects, and achievements.  
- Provide employers, collaborators, and clients with a professional first impression.  
- Offer direct ways to connect through contact links and call-to-action buttons.

## Self-Reflection

Working on this portfolio redesign gave me the chance to think more critically about how design and functionality influence user experience. It was not just about making a site look good, but about ensuring it communicates clearly and encourages interaction.

## What I Learned

I learned how to apply design frameworks like HITS to evaluate a website. On the technical side, I gained a better understanding of accessibility standards how design improves responsiveness.

## Challenges I Faced

One of the main challenges was balancing simplicity with detail. I wanted the portfolio to remain clean and easy to navigate, but also provide enough depth through case studies and blog content. To overcome this, I used a structured layout with clear navigation and CTAs, ensuring the site stays user-friendly without overwhelming visitors.

## Use of AI or External Help

I referred to resources like **MDN Web Docs** and **W3Schools** for technical clarity, and browsed real developer portfolios for inspiration. From this, I learned how to translate research and examples into my own design ideas while maintaining originality.

## If I Had More Time…

I would build an actual wireframe or prototype of the redesign, possibly in Figma or directly in code. I’d also explore adding animations and images. These improvements would make the site more engaging, flexible, and closer to a live professional portfolio.
